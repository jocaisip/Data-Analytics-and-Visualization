# Data Analytics and Visualization Projects

Repository for projects utilizing data analytics and visualization systems and tools.

## Navigation
My current folders in this repo are SQL and Tableau. 

- [SQL](https://github.com/jocaisip/Data-Analytics-and-Visualization/tree/main/SQL) is short for Structured Query Language and is a language used for querying relational databases. MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server are two systems I used to write queries and create tabular reports.

- [Tableau](https://github.com/jocaisip/Data-Analytics-and-Visualization/tree/main/Tableau) is data visualization software used in business intelligence and advanced analytics. I used Tableau to create worksheets and dashboards to analyze data and gather insights, and create a scorecard for KPI analysis.
